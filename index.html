            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                I focus on testing and analyzing crypto trading strategies specifically tailored for the Bybit market.
                My work involves experimenting with a variety of indicators and their combinations. All strategies are tested on a real account
                with real money, ensuring that the results reflect actual market conditions.
